# TrainBuddy

**TrainBuddy** is a personal fitness companion that generates dynamic workout plans and uses real-time pose tracking to monitor your form and count reps â€” all from your browser.

## ðŸ§  Overview

TrainBuddy bridges the gap between workout planning and execution. Using AI, it builds a personalized fitness plan. Then, through real-time computer vision, it tracks your form via webcam and counts your reps â€” offering both guidance and accountability.

## ðŸš€ Features

- AI-Generated Workout Plans â€“ Input your preferences and let GPT create a full weekâ€™s routine for push, pull, and core days.
- Exercise Library â€“ Clean UI with GIFs for visual reference across upper, lower, and core categories.
- Dynamic Routing â€“ Each exercise has its own dedicated page based on your plan.
- Real-Time Form Tracking â€“ Uses MediaPipe + OpenCV to detect your pose, track reps, and validate movement.
- Automatic Script Triggering â€“ Pressing the camera icon launches the correct Python tracking script for that exercise.
- Feedback Pop-up â€“ Clear notification that pose tracking has started.
- Rep Counting Logic â€“ Custom thresholds and state machines to detect complete reps based on keypoint motion.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Frontend** (React/Next.js):
   - Collects user input for workout goals.
   - Displays the exercise plan with individual pages for each activity.
   - Camera icon on each exercise page sends a request to the Flask backend.

2. **Backend** (Flask):
   - Receives requests from frontend.
   - Matches the exercise name with the appropriate Python tracking script using a lookup table.
   - Runs the script in a separate process and opens a webcam window for pose tracking.

3. **Tracking Scripts** (Python + MediaPipe):
   - Detects human pose from the webcam feed.
   - Monitors specific joints (like shoulder and elbow) for movement.
   - Counts reps based on motion thresholds and timing logic.
